# Backend API

This directory contains a minimal Express server for the Snack Track Insight application.

## Setup

From the project root directory:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The server will start on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable (defaults to `4000`).

## Transcription and Analysis

The backend uses **Azure Speech Services** to convert uploaded audio into text and **Azure AI Text Analytics** to evaluate the
transcription for sentiment and key phrases. Create these resources in the Azure Portal and provide their credentials via
environment variables as shown below.

## Environment Variables

For local development, create a `.env` file in the project root. In a production environment (like Azure App Service), set these as environment variables.

### Required Variables

-   `DB_HOST`: The hostname of your PostgreSQL database.
-   `DB_PORT`: The port of your PostgreSQL database.
-   `DB_USER`: The username for your PostgreSQL database.
-   `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for your PostgreSQL database.
-   `DB_NAME`: The name of your PostgreSQL database.
-   `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`: Key for your Azure Speech resource.
-   `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`: Region for your Azure Speech resource.
-   `AZURE_LANGUAGE_KEY`: Key for your Azure AI Language resource.
-   `AZURE_LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint URL for your Azure AI Language resource.

### Optional Variables

-   `PORT`: The port for the backend server to listen on (defaults to `4000`).
-   `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: If you want to store uploaded files in Azure Blob Storage, provide the connection string here.
-   `AZURE_AUDIO_CONTAINER`: The name of the Azure Blob Storage container for audio files.
-   `AZURE_MEDIA_CONTAINER`: The name of the Azure Blob Storage container for media files.
-   `CORS_ORIGIN`: A comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS requests.

Example `.env` file:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=snackuser
DB_PASSWORD=snackpass
DB_NAME=snacktrack
PORT=4000
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_speech_key
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_speech_region
AZURE_LANGUAGE_KEY=your_language_key
AZURE_LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=https://your-language-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
```

The server automatically loads variables from the `.env` file during local development. When deployed to Azure, it will use the environment variables configured in the App Settings.
